The state machine has 6 states.
These are represented by the modulus 5 counter.
The Modulus 5 counter is a 3 bit adder that utilizes T flip flops for each of the bits.
These T flip flops are chained together to form a binary adder.
When the counter reaches a decimal 6 (binary 110), it immediately goes back to decimal 0 (binary 000).
This effectively gives us a 0 to 5 counter.

The States are decoded using AND gates labeled S0 to S5.

The Inputs are decoded, checking if the previous state has failed labeled S0F to S5F (F for fail)

Everytime the enter/clock is pulsed, the sate machine increments.
The input values are matched against the new state, checking if the previous state has failed.
If it has failed, the FAIL D flip flop will go to logical high on a falling edge (To give it time to process the state/input matching, which occurs after going to a logical high, caused by the clock).

Once State 5 is reached
    If the fail bit went high, the Open pin remains a logical low.
    If the fail bit remained low, the Open pin goes to a logical high.

To close the lock again, the enter enter/clock must be pulsed again to return to State 0, which will set fail to a logical low, which will cause the Open pin to go to a logical low.
